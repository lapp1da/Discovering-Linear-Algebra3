  <title>Modeling Data and Moving Between Worlds</title>
  <p>
  In this section we will look at linear algebra as a way to encode information 
  and operate on it allowing us to move between different sets of information.  To this end, we 
  will define how matrices and vectors are operated on with binary operations like addition and 
  multiplication.  While multiplication of matrices may seem weird, you will see that it is defined 
  as it is for convenience in manipulating data and transforming different types of values into 
  other computed values based on them.  We begin by considering a case where we want to move between 
  a pricing scheme and the revenue it generates for three different companies with three different 
  sets of orders of our products.

      Suppose that a supplier provides four different products with prices, <m>
        p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 </m>, to three companies.  One thing we may want to do is to play with pricing
        schemes and look at the generated revenue we would get from each of the three companies.  
        Suppose we have orders from the three companies for each of our four products as given in the table below.

          Here we will use an example where the number of parameters in each set are different, although 
        we can have the same number of entries in each object (vector) can be the same.  In this case 
        we will have four entries in one set of vectors (prices of different products) meaning that 
        these vectors exist in <m>\mathbb{R}^4</m> such as <m>\begin{bmatrix}
      p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\p_4\end{bmatrix}</m> and three entries in 
        the other set of vectors (revenue from each of the three companies) existing in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> like <m>\begin{bmatrix}
      r_1\\r_2\\r_3\end{bmatrix}</m>.
