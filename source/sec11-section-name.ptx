  <title>Modeling Data and Moving Between Worlds</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
  In this section we will look at linear algebra as a way to encode information 
  and operate on it allowing us to move between different sets of information.  We begin 
  by considering a case where we want to move between a pricing scheme and the revenue it 
  generates for three different companies with three different sets of orders.

      Suppose that a supplier provides four different products with prices, <m>
        p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 </m> to three companies.  One thing we may want to do is to play with pricing
        schemes and look at the generated revenue we would get from each of the three companies.  Here 
        we will use an example where the number of parameters in each set are different, although 
        we can have the same number of entries in each object (vector) can be the same.  In this case 
        we will have four entries in one set of vectors (prices of different products) <m>\begin{bmatrix}
      p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\p_4\end{bmatrix}</m> and three entries in 
        the other set of vectors (revenue from each of the three companies) <m>\begin{bmatrix}
      r_1\\r_2\\r_3\end{bmatrix}</m>.

      p_1 \begin{bmatrix}
      14\\32\\21\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \begin{bmatrix}
      9\\7\\8\end{bmatrix} + p_3 \begin{bmatrix}
      34\\12\\5\end{bmatrix} + p_4 \begin{bmatrix}
      41\\52\\23\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
      r_1\\r_2\\r_3\end{bmatrix}
